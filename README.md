The study of complex networks is a young and active area of scientific research inspired largely by the empirical study of real-world networks such as computer networks, social networks etc. Social network analysis focuses on uncovering the pattern of people's interaction. A social network has a set of actors (nodes) that have relationships (edges or ties) with one another. This project aims at building a rigorous pattern for understanding the relationships and interactions critical to understanding how behaviors spread. With the understanding of the nature of the network  we propose a method to find the most influential nodes which are vital for reaching out to the most of the network in a minimum span of time.
